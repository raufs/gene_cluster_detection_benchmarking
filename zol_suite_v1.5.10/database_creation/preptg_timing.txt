Nowadays, the FASTA file format is usually understood not to have any such comments, and most software packages do not allow them. Therefore, the use of comments at the beginning of a FASTA file is now deprecated in Biopython.

In a future Biopython release, this deprecation warning will be replaced by a ValueError. To avoid this, there are three options:

(1) Modify your FASTA file to remove such comments at the beginning of the file.

(2) Use SeqIO.parse with the 'fasta-pearson' format instead of 'fasta'. This format is consistent with the FASTA format defined by William Pearson's FASTA aligner software. Thie format allows for comments before the first sequence; lines starting with the ';' character anywhere in the file are also regarded as comment lines and are ignored.

(3) Use the 'fasta-blast' format. This format regards any lines starting with '!', '#', or ';' as comment lines. The 'fasta-blast' format may be safer than the 'fasta-pearson' format, as it explicitly indicates which lines are comments.

/workspace/local/rauf/zol_development/benchmark/zol_v1.5.10_env/lib/python3.10/site-packages/Bio/SeqIO/FastaIO.py:203: BiopythonDeprecationWarning: Previously, the FASTA parser silently ignored comments at the beginning of the FASTA file (before the first sequence).

Nowadays, the FASTA file format is usually understood not to have any such comments, and most software packages do not allow them. Therefore, the use of comments at the beginning of a FASTA file is now deprecated in Biopython.

In a future Biopython release, this deprecation warning will be replaced by a ValueError. To avoid this, there are three options:

(1) Modify your FASTA file to remove such comments at the beginning of the file.

(2) Use SeqIO.parse with the 'fasta-pearson' format instead of 'fasta'. This format is consistent with the FASTA format defined by William Pearson's FASTA aligner software. Thie format allows for comments before the first sequence; lines starting with the ';' character anywhere in the file are also regarded as comment lines and are ignored.

(3) Use the 'fasta-blast' format. This format regards any lines starting with '!', '#', or ';' as comment lines. The 'fasta-blast' format may be safer than the 'fasta-pearson' format, as it explicitly indicates which lines are comments.
